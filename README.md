# Resi-Dont - Group8 Security Project
### By: Tyler Sanbar, Peyton Richardson, Parker Brandt


## The Project
The Resi-Dont smartphone lock system is designed to be a higher security option to log into a smartphone compared to the standard PIN or graphical swipe method. The system is meant to confuse any third party observers who may be watching the user log in on their phone, or to obfuscate any marks on the user's phone in order to prevent any smudge attacks.

## How to Run
To run the Resi-Dont application, first download the latest version of Android Studio from the link https://developer.android.com/studio</br>
Then, open Android Studio and choose to open a project and select the 'SecurityProject' file as the project</br>
The project will then open and the Gradle build script will build the project

Click 'Open AVD Manager' and choose to download 'Pixel 2 API 30'</br>
Click the green 'Run' button and Android Studio will open the emulator and run the application through the emulator

### Option 2: Run on an Android Device
